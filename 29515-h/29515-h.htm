<p>In the days of my season of salad,</p>

</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>I sang of false faith that is fleeting</p>

<p>Time&#8217;s curse that is fatal as Keating</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Is fatal to amorous fleas;</p>

<p><span class='indent28'>&nbsp;</span>Next I saw</p>
<p>A pensive gentleman of middle age,</p>
<p>That leaned against a Druid oak, his pipe</p>
<p>Pendent beneath his chin&ndash;&ndash;a double one&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>(Meaning the pipe); reluctant was his breath,</p>
<p>For he had mingled in the Morris dance</p>
<p>And rested blown; but damsels in their teens,</p>
<p>All decorous and decorously clad,</p>
<p>Their very ankles hardly visible,</p>
<p>Recalled his motions; while, for chaperon,</p>
<p>Good Mrs. Grundy up against the wall</p>
<p>Beamed approbation.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='indent26'>&nbsp;</span>On his face I read</p>
<p>Signs of high sadness such as poets wear,</p>
<p>Being divinely discontented with</p>
<p>The praise of <i>jeunes filles</i>. Even as I looked,</p>
<p>He touched the portion of his pipe reserved</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>For minor poetry of solemn tone,</p>
<p>Checking the humorous stops intended for</p>
<p>Electioneering posters and the like;</p>
<p>And therewithal he made the following</p>
<p>Addition to his <i>Songs Unsung</i>, or else</p>
<p>His <i>Unremarked Remarks</i>:</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='indent24'>&nbsp;</span>&#8220;Dear Sir,&#8221; he said,</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse my saying &#8216;Sir&#8217; like that; it is</p>
<p>Our way in Hades here among the damned;</p>
<p>For you must know that some of us are damned</p>
<p>Not only by faint praise but full applause</p>
<p>Of simple critics. Take my case. In me</p>
<p>Behold the good knight Marsyas, M.A.,</p>
<p>Three times a candidate for Parliament,</p>
<p>And twice retired; a Justice of the Peace;</p>
<p>Master of Arts (I said), and better known</p>
<p>In literary spheres as Master of</p>
<p>The Mediocre-Obvious; and read</p>
<p>By boarding-misses in their myriads.</p>
<p>These dote upon me. Sweetly have I sung</p>
<p>The commonplaces of philosophy</p>
<p>In common parlance.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p><span class='indent18'>&nbsp;</span>You have read perhaps</p>
<p>The Cymric Triads? Poetry, they say,</p>
<p>Excels alone by sheer simplicity</p>
<p>Of language, subject, and invention. Sir!</p>
<p>The excellence of mine lay that way too.</p>
<p>But fate is partial. Heaven&#8217;s fulgour moulds</p>
<p>&#8216;To happiness some, some to unhappiness!&#8217;</p>
<p>(Look you, the harp was Welsh that figured forth</p>
<p>That excellent last line.) I ask you, Sir,</p>
<p>What would you? Ill content with mortal praise,</p>
<p>And haply somewhat overbold, I sought</p>
<p>To be as gods be; sought, in fact, to filch</p>
<p>Apollo&#8217;s bays!</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='indent18'>&nbsp;</span>Ah me! Dear me! I fain</p>
<p>Would use a stronger phrase, but hardly dare,</p>

<p>I say I tired of vulgar homage, gift</p>
<p>Of ignorance. &#8216;High failure overleaps</p>
<p>The bounds of low successes&#8217; (there, again,</p>
<p>The harp that twanged was Welsh, but with an echo</p>
<p>Of Browning). Godlike it must be, I thought,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>

<p>A little; but it takes a lot of time,</p>

<p>Polished the waxen tablets, and began</p>

<p>Away by the haunts of the Yang-tse-boo,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Where the Yuletide runs cold gin,</p>
<p>And the rollicking sign of the <i>Lord Knows Who</i></p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Sees mariners drink like sin;</p>
<p>Where the <i>Jolly Roger</i> tips his quart</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>To the luck of the <i>Union Jack</i>;</p>
<p>And some are screwed on the foreign port,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>And some on the starboard tack;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Ever they tell the tale anew</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Of the chase for the kipperling swag;</p>
<p>How the smack <i>Tommy This</i> and the smack <i>Tommy That</i></p>
<p>They broached each other like a whiskey-vat,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>And the <i>Fuzzy-Wuz</i> took the bag.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>Now this is the law of the herring fleet that harries the northern main,</p>
<p>Tattooed in scars on the chests of the tars with a brand like the brand of Cain:</p>
<p>That none may woo the sea-born shrew save such as pay their way</p>
<p>With a kipperling netted at noon of night and cured ere the crack of day.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>It was the woman Sal o&#8217; the Dune, and the men were three to one,</p>
<p>Bill the Skipper and Ned the Nipper and Sam that was Son of a Gun;</p>
<p>Bill was a Skipper and Ned was a Nipper and Sam was the Son of a Gun,</p>
<p>And the woman was Sal o&#8217; the Dune, as I said, and the men were three to one.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>There was never a light in the sky that night of the soft midsummer gales,</p>
<p>But the great man-bloaters snorted low, and the young &#8217;uns sang like whales;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>And out laughed Sal (like a dog-toothed wheel was the laugh that Sal laughed she):</p>
<p>&#8220;Now who&#8217;s for a bride on the shady side of up&#8217;ards of forty-three?&#8221;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>And Neddy he swore by butt and bend, and Billy by bend and bitt,</p>
<p>And nautical names that no man frames but your amateur nautical wit;</p>
<p>And Sam said, &#8220;Shiver my topping-lifts and scuttle my foc&#8217;s&#8217;le yarn,</p>
<p>And may I be curst, if I&#8217;m not in first with a kipperling slued astarn!&#8221;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Now the smack <i>Tommy This</i> and the smack <i>Tommy That</i> and the <i>Fuzzy-Wuz</i> smack, all three,</p>
<p>Their captains bold, they were Bill and Ned and Sam respectivelee.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>And it&#8217;s writ in the rules that the primary schools of kippers should get off cheap</p>
<p>For a two mile reach off Foulness beach when the July tide&#8217;s at neap;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>And the lawless lubbers that lust for loot and filch the yearling stock</p>
<p>They get smart raps from the coastguard chaps with their blunderbuss fixed half-cock.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Now Bill the Skipper and Ned the Nipper could tell green cheese from blue,</p>
<p>And Bill knew a trick and Ned knew a trick, but Sam knew a trick worth two.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>So Bill he sneaks a corporal&#8217;s breeks and a belt of pipeclayed hide,</p>
<p>And splices them on to the jibsail-boom like a troopship on the tide.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>And likewise Ned to his masthead he runs a rag of the Queen&#8217;s,</p>
<p>With a rusty sword and a moke on board to bray like the Horse Marines.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>But Sam sniffs gore and he keeps off-shore and he waits for things to stir,</p>
<p>Then he tracks for the deep with a long fog-horn rigged up like a bowchas&eacute;r.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>Now scarce had Ned dropped line and lead when he spots the pipeclayed hide,</p>
<p>And the corporal&#8217;s breeks on the jibsail-boom like a troopship on the tide;</p>
<p>And Bill likewise, when he ups and spies the slip of a rag of the Queen&#8217;s,</p>
<p>And the rusty sword, and he sniffs aboard the moke of the Horse Marines.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>So they each luffed sail, and they each turned tail, and they whipped their wheels like mad,</p>
<p>When the one he said &#8220;By the Lord, it&#8217;s Ned!&#8221; and the other, &#8220;It&#8217;s Bill, by Gad!&#8221;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Then about and about, and nozzle to snout, they rammed through breach and brace,</p>
<p>And the splinters flew as they mostly do when a Government test takes place.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Then up stole Sam with his little ram and the nautical talk flowed free,</p>
<p>And in good bold type might have covered the two front sheets of the <i>P. M. G.</i></p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>But the fog-horn bluff was safe enough, where all was weed and weft,</p>
<p>And the conger-eels were a-making meals, and the pick of the tackle left</p>
<p>Was a binnacle-lid and a leak in the bilge and the chip of a cracked sheerstrake</p>
<p>And the corporal&#8217;s belt and the moke&#8217;s cool pelt and a portrait of Francis Drake.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>So Sam he hauls the dead men&#8217;s trawls and he booms for the harbour-bar,</p>
<p>And the splitten fry are salted dry by the blink of the morning star.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>And Sal o&#8217; the Dune was wed next moon by the man that paid his way</p>
<p>With a kipperling netted at noon of night and cured ere the crack of day;</p>
<p>For such is the law of the herring fleet that bloats on the northern main,</p>
<p>Tattooed in scars on the chests of the tars with a brand like the brand of Cain.</p>

<h2>II. TO MR. WILLIAM WATSON.</h2>
</div>
<p class='intro'>[On writing the first instalment of <i>The Purple East</i>, a &#8216;fine
sonnet which it is our privilege to publish.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Westminster
Gazette</i>, Dec. 16, 1895.]</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Dear Mr. Watson, we have heard with wonder,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Not all unmingled with a sad regret,</p>
<p>That little penny blast of purple thunder,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>You issued in the <i>Westminster Gazette</i>;</p>
<p>The Editor describes it as a sonnet;</p>
<p>I wish to make a few remarks upon it.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><i>Never, O craven England, nevermore</i></p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span><i>Prate thou of generous effort, righteous aim!</i></p>
<p>So ran the lines, and left me very sore,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>For you may guess my heart was hot with shame:</p>
<p>Even thus early in your ample song</p>
<p>I felt that something must be really wrong.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>But when I learned that our ignoble nation</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Lay sleeping like a log, and lay alone,</p>
<p>Propping, according to your information,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span><i>Abdul the Damned on his infernal throne</i>,</p>
<p>O then I scattered to the wind my fears,</p>
<p>And nearly went and joined the Volunteers.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>But just in time the thought occurred to me</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>That England commonly commits her course</p>
<p>To men as good at heart as even we</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>And possibly much richer in resource;</p>
<p>That we had better mind our own affairs</p>
<p>And leave these gentlemen to manage theirs.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>It further seemed a work uncommon light</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>For one like you, a casual civilian,</p>
<p>To order half a hemisphere to fight</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>And slaughter one another by the million,</p>
<p>While you yourself, a paper Galahad,</p>
<p>Spilt ink for blood upon a blotting-pad.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>The days are gone when sword and poet&#8217;s pen</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>One gallant gifted hand was wont to wield;</p>
<p>When Taillefer in face of Harold&#8217;s men</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Rode foremost on to Senlac&#8217;s fatal field,</p>
<p>And tossed his sword in air, and sang a spell</p>
<p>Of Roland&#8217;s battle-song, and, singing, fell.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>The days are gone when troubadours by dozens</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Polished their steel and joined the stout crusade,</p>
<p>Strumming, in memory of pretty cousins,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span><i>The Girl I left behind Me</i>, on parade;</p>
<p>They often used to rattle off a ballad in</p>
<p>The intervals of punishing the Saladin.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>In later times, of course I know there&#8217;s Byron,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Who by his own report could play the man;</p>
<p>I seem to see him with his Lesbian lyre on,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>And brandishing a useful yataghan;</p>
<p>Though never going altogether strong, he</p>
<p>Managed at least to die at Missolonghi.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>No more the trades of lute and lance are linked,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Though doubtless under many martial bonnets</p>
<p>Brave heads there be that harbour the distinct</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Belief that they can manufacture sonnets;</p>
<p>But on the other hand a bard is not</p>
<p>Supposed to run the risk of being shot.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Then since your courage lacks a crucial test,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>And politics were never your profession,</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Watson, won&#8217;t you find it best</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>To temper valour with a due discretion?</p>
<p>That so, despite the fond <i>Spectator&#8217;s</i> booming,</p>
<p>Above your brow the bays may yet be blooming.</p>

</div><blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The new &#8216;Rejected Addresses&#8217; of Mr. Owen Seaman are quite worthy
to be ranked with the classic volumes of Horace and James.... The
thing is done as well as it could be.... This little volume is <i>merum
sal</i>.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;<i>The Spectator</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Kipling has never been so nimbly caught before, for Mr. Seaman
has the art to reproduce his flute-notes as well as his big drum....
Several of the miscellaneous pieces are among the very best humourous
poetry of this generation. We have laughed at nothing lately more than at
&#8216;Ars Postera,&#8217; at &#8216;A New Blue Book,&#8217; at &#8216;To a Boy-Poet of the Decadence,&#8217;
and at &#8216;To Julia in Shooting Togs.&#8217; But, after all, Mr. Seaman&#8217;s masterpiece
up to date is certainly &#8216;To the Lord of Potsdam.&#8217; ... This will
live, or we are greatly mistaken, among the most effective examples of
historical satire-lyric.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;<i>The Saturday Review</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is certainly remarkable, in our dearth of great poetry, how good of
its sort the satiric verse of our day is&ndash;&ndash;so good, in fact, that nothing but the
best will serve, and even the best, like Mr. Seaman&#8217;s, which in the day
when Sir George Trevelyan was a wit would have taken people&#8217;s breath
away, is apt to be treated as mere journalism.... But really it is the
most characteristic expression of our time, using the accustomed forms of
verse to point the neatest criticisms and the slyest of epigrams....
Mr. Seaman&#8217;s humourous imitation of Mr. Swinburne, Sir Edwin Arnold,
Sir Lewis Morris, Mr. Kipling, and the rest, is in every case very funny.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;<i>St.
James&#8217;s Gazette</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The book abounds in excellent fooling and really wholesome satire,
the ingenuity and felicity of verse and expression giving it likewise a high
artistic value.... Quips and cranks of audacious wit, strokes of a
humour always sane and healthy, waylay the reader incessantly, and leave
him no peace for laughter.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;<i>The Westminster Gazette</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Seaman must be tired of being compared to Calverley and J.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;S.,
but he is of their company, and, what is more, on their level. &#8216;The Battle
of the Bays&#8217; ... bristles with points; it is brilliant, ... and it
has that easy conversational flow which is the one absolutely necessary
characteristic of good humourous poetry.... One charm of writing
such as Mr. Seaman&#8217;s is that it makes us feel quite obliged to poets whom
we have never admired for being so good to parody.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Owen Seaman has a very neat talent for parody.... The
&#8216;Ballad of a Bun&#8217; is exceedingly funny, and ought to make even Mr. John
Davidson laugh.... All the imitations are good.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;<i>The Times</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;His versatility and bright and ready wit are conspicuous in all his
work. As a parodist he is second to none, not even to Mr. Calverley, if we
may take the word of the reviewers.... Mr. Seaman cracks the whip
with consummate skill, and <a name='TC_4'></a><ins title="Was 'applys'">applies</ins> it with such naughty <ins title="Was 'precison'">precision</ins>, that even
his victims must find it difficult to withhold their admiration.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;<i>The
National Observer</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the political sphere Mr. Seaman is at present without a rival.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;<i>The
Globe</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Taken as a whole, we are much mistaken if any better volume of
political verse has made its appearance since the days of the <i>Rolliad</i> and
the <i>Anti-Jacobin</i>.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;<i>The World</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best of the satirists on the other side is Mr. Owen Seaman, who
has touched off some of the weaknesses of the late government with very
happy and caustic humour.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;<i>The Spectator</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Seaman is own brother to Calverley, and in modern times there
has been nothing so good of its sort as <a name='TC_5'></a><ins title="Changed to single quotes">&#8216;Tillers of the Sand.&#8217;</ins>... Mr.
Seaman proves himself so brilliant a jester that it needs must be he takes
the jester&#8217;s privilege of offending no one.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;<i>The Speaker</i>.</p>

</div><blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Here is no shouting, no banging of the bauble. The form of phrase,
the inflexion of voice, the dancing light of humour, make up the motley
which is the true jester&#8217;s <a name='TC_6'></a><ins title="Changed to single quotes">&#8216;only wear&#8217;</ins>; and under his flashes of merriment
is a sober, sound philosophy. This, after all, is the only kind of humour
that lasts ... it is easy to appreciate, difficult to acquire; and Mr.
Owen Seaman, having acquired it with all the felicity of good humour and
art, stands practically alone among the humourists of the hour....
His technical quality seems to strengthen with every new volume.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;Mr.
<span class='smcap'><a name='TC_7'></a><ins title="Was 'Arthuh'">Arthur</ins> Waugh</span> in <i>The St. James&#8217; Gazette</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clean laughter, and scholarly wit; polished metre, and humorous
phrase&ndash;&ndash;these are to me the essential characteristics for which I am invariably
glad to read Mr. Owen Seaman.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;Mr.
<span class='smcap'>Theodore Cook</span> in <i>Literature</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The brilliant author of &#8216;Cap and Bells&#8217; assumes, before the eyes of a
later generation, the mantle of Crawley, and does the same sort of work
more felicitously still.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;<i>The Speaker</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of the volume Mr. Seaman gives agreeable evidence that,
in the domain of memorial and complimentary verse, he has the knack of
combining felicity of phrase with a wholesome avoidance alike of adulation
and excess. The &#8216;In Memoriam&#8217; lines to Lewis Carroll, with the graceful
reference to Sir John Tenniel, are particularly happy.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;<i>The Spectator</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Calverley had not, or did not show in his verses, Mr. Seaman&#8217;s
critical acuteness and depth.... As a critic in the form of parody, Mr.
Seaman is without a rival.... Of his serious poems an ode to Queen
Wilhelmina is a very graceful accomplishment of a difficult task.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;Mr.
<span class='smcap'>G. S. Street</span> in <i>The Pall Mall Magazine</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Seaman is what we may call a critic of mannerisms, and a very
keen critic to boot. His is a useful, not a merely destructive, function. He
is no wanton debaser of the poetic currency. One might rather call him a
touchstone of true merit in poetry.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Daily Chronicle</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;A new volume from the pen of Mr. Owen Seaman must needs be
welcome. He is the most accomplished versifier among all our jesters.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;<i>The
Globe</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The parodies in Mr. Seaman&#8217;s new volume are wonderful examples of
this difficult art; the Stephen Phillips, the Alfred Austin, the Watts-Dunton,
and the George Meredith are faultless.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Academy</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Owen Seaman has already made his reputation as, perhaps, the
surest modern poet to make you laugh, and the nature of his new collection
of copies of verse cannot be better described than by saying that it is well
worthy of his hand.... The book is heartsome and delightful all
through.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;<i>The Scotsman</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The present vogue of Mr. Owen Seaman&#8217;s delightful parodies is very
great.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Liverpool Courier</i>.</p>
